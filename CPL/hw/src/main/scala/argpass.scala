/* INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * Complete the exercises below.  For each "EXERCISE" comment, add
 * code immediately below the comment.
 *
 * Please see README.md for instructions, including compilation and testing.
 * 
 * GRADING
 * 
 * 1. Submissions MUST compile using SBT with UNCHANGED configuration and tests with no
 *    compilation errors.  Submissions with compilation errors will receive 0 points.
 *    Note that refactoring the code will cause the tests to fail.
 *
 * 2. You MUST NOT edit the SBT configuration and tests.  Altering it in your submission will
 *    result in 0 points for this assignment.
 *
 * 3. You MUST NOT use while loops or (re)assignment to variables (you can use "val" declarations,
 *    but not "var" declarations).  You must use recursion instead.
 *
 * 4. You may declare auxiliary functions if you like.
 *
 * SUBMISSION
 *
 * 1. Submit this file on D2L before the deadline.
 *
 * 2. Late submissions will not be permitted because solutions will be discussed in class.

  // EXERCISE 1: complete the following higher-order function.
  // It has one parameter f: a function that takes an instance of RefInt (see above for the definition of the class RefInt) and returns Unit (i.e., nothing interesting).
  // Your code must create ONLY ONE instance of RefInt, then call f three times.
  // f will update the integer stored in the instances of RefInt it is given.
  // Your code must return a tuple of the three integers provided by f in the order that they came back from calls, i.e., the integer from the first call to f is the first integer in the returned tuple.
  def refint1 (f : RefInt => Unit) : (Int, Int, Int) = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    // Example call:
    // val r = new RefInt (0)
    // f (r)
    // val n : Int = r.get
    val r = new RefInt (0)

    f(r)

  // EXERCISE 2: complete the following higher-order function.
  // It has one parameter f: a function that takes an instance of RefInt (see above for the definition of the class RefInt) and returns Unit (i.e., nothing interesting).
  // Your code must create EXACTLY THREE instances of RefInt, then call f three times.
  // f will update the integer stored in the instances of RefInt it is given.
  // However, f will not do this update immediately.  
  // It will only do it after the third call to f: at that point it updates all three instances of RefInt that it has received as arguments so far.
  // Your code must return a tuple of the three integers provided by f in the order that they came back from calls, i.e., the integer from the first call to f is the first integer in the returned tuple.

  // EXERCISE 3: complete the following function.
  // It has one parameter r: (a reference to) an instance of RefInt (see above for the definition of the class RefInt) and returns (a reference to) an instance of RefInt.
  // Your code must increment (add 1 to) the RefInt it receives and return double the original value (stored in a separate RefInt instance) as the result.
  def refint3 (r : RefInt) : RefInt = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    val n1r1: Int = r.get

  // EXERCISE 4: complete the following function.
  // It has two parameters
  // - r: (a reference to) an instance of RefInt (see above for the definition of the class RefInt); AND
  // - f: a function that accepts (a reference to) an instance of RefInt.
  // Your code must call f with a *copy* of the RefInt r, i.e., it must make a new instance of RefInt with the same Int.
  // Your code should return true if f has NOT changed the Int stored in the copy of r.  Otherwise it should return false.
  def refint4 (r : RefInt, f : RefInt => Unit) : Boolean = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
    val rNum = r.get
    val r2 = new RefInt(rNum)

    f(r2)

    val r2Num = r2.get

    if (rNum == r2Num) true
    else false

  }

  // EXERCISE 5: complete the following function.
  // It has one parameter: a list of (references to) RefInt instances.
  // Your code must CHANGE the argument it receives in a way that is visible to the caller.
  // Note that this is the Scala List type, which is immutable!
  // You can assume that the list you receive is not empty.
  def refint5 (xs : List[RefInt]) : Unit = {
    // TODO: Provide definition here.
   xs match {
     case Nil => Unit
     case x::xs => val xNum = x.get; x.set(xNum+1); refint5(xs);
